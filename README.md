# Addition-Subtraction-Logical-operations
For addition and subtraction , I have used the same circuit and the only change in carry_in.

For AND,OR,XOR Operations there are 8 switches(4 for each 4-bit binary no.).One end of switch is connected to the Vcc=5V and the other end is connected to respective gates.
7 segment common anode LEDs are used to show the output.
